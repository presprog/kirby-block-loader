# Block Loader

> ‚ö° Your block *blueprints* and *snippets* **in one place** 

```php
// Have everything nicely grouped together. Let our plugin do the heavy lifting.
üìÇ site
    üìÇ blocks
        üìÇ call-to-action
            üìÑ call-to-action.yml   // Block blueprint
            üìÑ call-to-action.php   // Block snippet
```

You store blueprints and snippets for your custom blocks in different locations by default: Blueprints go to `site/blueprints/blocks` and snippets go to `site/snippets/blocks`. How about having all files that form a new block in one folder and let this plugin take care of loading and registering everything?

## How to use

Say you would like to add a custom `call to action` block. At least a blueprint and a snippet are required. Rather than placing them in separate folders, we use this plugin to have them nicely grouped together:

1. create a folder `site/blocks`. This is where all your custom blocks go. This can be configured with a custom root `blocks` in your `index.php`.
2. Create a folder `call-to-action` inside `site/blocks`. This is where your blueprint and snippet(s) go.
3. Add a file `call-to-action.yml` and set up your blueprint
4. Add a file `call-to-action.php` and render your block as you would like in any other snippet.

The plugin will scan the folder and register both the blueprint and snippet as `blocks/call-to-action`:

```php
// [‚Ä¶]
    'blueprints' => [
        'blocks/call-to-action' => 'site/blocks/call-to-action/call-to-action.yml',
    ], 
    'snippets' => [
        'blocks/call-to-action' => 'site/blocks/call-to-action/call-to-action.php',
    ],
// [‚Ä¶]
```

## Alternatives

[microman/components](https://getkirby.com/plugins/microman/components) tries to solve this problem, too and introduces the new concept of components. This is a more versatile approach, as components can be anything. Our plugin only works for blocks.
